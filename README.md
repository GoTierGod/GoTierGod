Iván Zamorano @GoTierGod | Full-Stack Web Developer

Dedicated web developer with a solid foundation built over 2
years of high-quality learning, spanning around tens of courses,
relevant certifications and lots of self-study. My knowledge is not
only theoretical; I bring a lot of practical experience acquired
through several practical projects thought, designed and
programmed by me.  

My enthusiasm for continued growth extends beyond specific
frameworks. I am a fast and adaptable learner, investing many
hours reading documentation and exploring new concepts,
making me an expert in seamlessly transitioning between
different technologies.
