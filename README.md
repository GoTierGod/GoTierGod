👨‍💻 Profile
Full-stack developer specialized in modern web development, with real experience in end-to-end projects: from architecture and interface design to development, deployment, and production optimization. I have worked as a freelance developer building complete websites and conducting technical audits focused on performance, essential security, and user experience.
I’m characterized by a solid foundation in JavaScript and TypeScript, logical thinking, a strong focus on best practices, and disciplined continuous learning. I combine self-taught training with formal studies as a Programming Analyst, which allows me to merge technical judgment with academic fundamentals.

🚀 Career Path
I began my journey in software development as a self-taught learner for several years, building real-world projects and solving practical problems. I am currently pursuing a degree as a Programming Analyst while continuing my professional development.
